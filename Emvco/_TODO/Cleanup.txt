Each process has its own unique session struct. Is this overkill? Unify the session keys
if we don't need type uniqueness when finding equality

You used Transaction and other custom shared objects as a crutch. begin to refactor that to what the
EMV specification dictates

Combine Play.Emv.Codecs with Play.Codecs. The IPlayCodec has pretty much everything we need
for our framework. So you can replace System.Text.Encoding inheritance with IPlayCodec and 
get rid of an assembly misdirection. You can still keep the extra functions that are implemented
in Play.Codecs and add interfaces or something

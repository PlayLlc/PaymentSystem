REFACTORING
====================================================================================
You're going to merge the Play.Emv.Pcd modules with the Play.Emv.Card modules

1) Change the QueryPcdRequest and QueryPcdResponse to include a Card Command and 
CardResponse instead of an RAPDU and CAPDU

2) Update all CardCommand and CardResponse objects to inherit from QueryPcdRequest
and QueryPcdResponse

3) Inject a CardClient into the ProximityCouplingDeviceProcess

4) When an incoming request is received, resolve the CardCommand type to the appropriate
overloaded handler

5) In the overloaded handler, the CardClient will interact with the PICC in real time. 
When the PICC returns the byte[] response, the CardClient will deserialize the
response into the appropriate CardResponse object. 

6) Once the CardResponse is deserialized, send the response to the appropriate channel
by calling EndpointClient.Handle(CardResponse)

7) The MessageRouter will deliver the concrete CardResponse to the Channel who sent the
request



Oh geez
